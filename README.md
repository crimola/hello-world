# hello-world
#
# Going through the quick hello-world Git to refresh... My intention is not to miss anything
# about git from the bottom up. Specially in comparison to all the other version control
# systems I have used, like PVCS, CVS, SVN and even MS SourceSafe! I am dating myself here :-)
#
# The hello-world activity suggests I say something about myself - I'll be brief, my experience
# as a software developer is mainly in systems and networks dev. Most relevant to the present is
# my depth of experience in Unix/Linux, RTOS (e.g., VxWorks), Embedded systems and the implementation
# L2/L3 protocols as per their specifications.
